	Problem:
		Climbing Stairs

		You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach the top.
		Each time you can either climb one or two steps.
		In how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

	Framework for Solving DP Problems:
		1. Define the objective function
			f(i) is the number of distinct ways to reach the i-th stair
		2. Identify base cases
			f(0) = 1
			f(1) = 1
		3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function
			f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
		4. What's the order of execution
			bottom-up
		5. Where to look for the answer
			f(n)
